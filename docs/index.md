# The Art of Literary Text Mining

This is a meta-guide that is intended to help you work through our sub-guides for _The Art of Literary Text Mining_:

1. The Art of Literary Text Mining for Voyant
1. The Art of Literary Text Mining for Python Jupyter Notebooks
1. The Art of Literary Text Mining for ObservableHQ

Usually you would probably want to work through just one of these guides but there are cases when working with one or more guides together is preferable; this meta-guide is for this mixed approach.

Why work through the materials of more than one guide? One reason is to fully appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of more than one approach. We firmly believe that no one tool or even one framework is ideal for all problems and that it can be useful to be familiar with more than solution.

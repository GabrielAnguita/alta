# Visualizing with the Art of Literary Text Mining

Voyant is in large part about visualization so we won't spend too much time with it here except to refer to a couple of tools that are perhaps less on the beaten path:

1. Bubbles
1. TextArc

But there are many others, have a look!

## Embedding Voyant

<iframe src="https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Knots/?corpus=austen" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; float: right;"></iframe> One of the more powerful aspects of Voyant is that you can embed a live, functional tool in another page, much as you would embed a video clip from YouTube or Vimeo. See the [documentations](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/embedding).
